ProjectSpecificKeys
    Set up key bindings that only apply in specific projects

https://github.com/OdatNurd/ProjectSpecificKeys

This package allows you to add key bindings to a sublime-project file in
order to have those bindings available only within that particular
project. Bindings made this way will override the default key bindings,
but only within windows that have the project loaded.

For more information on how to set up your key bindings, please view the
documentation by selecting "ProjectSpecificKeys: Open README" from the
command palette.
